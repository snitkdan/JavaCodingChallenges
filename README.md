# JavaCodingChallenges
This repo is a good starting point for doing coding challenges in Java

# Directory Structure
* code.java - where you can work on the answers for your coding challenge
* test.java - where you can write unit tests for your coding challenge. 

# How to run if not in an IDE (commands run within this directory on a terminal)
1. `javac *.class`
2. `java Test`
3. You can clean up the `*.class` files by running `rm *.class`
